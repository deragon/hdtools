DATASET IN DATASTAGE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  From:  https://datastage4you.blogspot.com/2012/12/dataset-in-datastage.html

  Inside a InfoSphere DataStage parallel job, data is moved around in data
  sets. These carry meta data with them, both column definitions and
  information about the configuration that was in effect when the data set was
  created. If for example, you have a stage which limits execution to a subset
  of available nodes, and the data set was created by a stage using all nodes,
  InfoSphere DataStage can detect that the data will need repartitioning.

  If required, data sets can be landed as persistent data sets, represented by
  a Data Set stage .This is the most efficient way of moving data between
  linked jobs. Persistent data sets are stored in a series of files linked by
  a control file (note that you should not attempt to manipulate these files
  using UNIX tools such as RM or MV. Always use the tools provided with
  InfoSphere DataStage).  there are the two groups of Datasets - persistent
  and virtual.

  The first type, persistent Datasets are marked with *.ds extensions, while
  for second type, virtual datasets *.v extension is reserved. (It's important
  to mention, that no *.v files might be visible in the Unix file system, as
  long as they exist only virtually, while inhabiting RAM memory. Extesion *.v
  itself is characteristic strictly for OSH - the Orchestrate language of
  scripting).

  Further differences are much more significant. Primarily, persistent
  Datasets are being stored in Unix files using internal Datastage EE format,
  while virtual Datasets are never stored on disk - they do exist within
  links, and in EE format, but in RAM memory. Finally, persistent Datasets are
  readable and rewriteable with the DataSet Stage, and virtual Datasets -
  might be passed through in memory.

  A data set comprises a descriptor file and a number of other files that are
  added as the data set grows. These files are stored on multiple disks in
  your system. A data set is organized in terms of partitions and segments.

  Each partition of a data set is stored on a single processing node. Each
  data segment contains all the records written by a single job. So a segment
  can contain files from many partitions, and a partition has files from many
  segments.

  Firstly, as a single Dataset contains multiple records, it is obvious that
  all of them must undergo the same processes and modifications. In a word,
  all of them must go through the same successive stage.  Secondly, it should
  be expected that different Datasets usually have different schemas,
  therefore they cannot be treated commonly.

  Alias names of Datasets are

    1) Orchestrate File
    2) Operating System file

  And Dataset is multiple files. They are

    a) Descriptor File
    b) Data File
    c) Control file
    d) Header Files

  In Descriptor File, we can see the Schema details and address of data.  In
  Data File, we can see the data in Native format.  And Control and Header
  files resides in Operating System.
