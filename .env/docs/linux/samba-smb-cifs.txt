    Ports 137-139 are for NetBios/Name resolution.  Without it you will have
    to access machines by DNS or IP address opposed to NetBIOS name.  Thus,
    port 445 is the only port required to be open usually, as DNS/IP is good
    enough for most scenarios.

CIFS VS SMB
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  From:  https://www.varonis.com/blog/cifs-vs-smb/

  Conclusion:  USE SMB, NOT CIFS (which is an old dialect of SMB)

  SMB

    So what is SMB? SMB stands for “Server Message Block.” It’s a file sharing
    protocol that was invented by IBM and has been around since the
    mid-eighties. Since it’s a protocol (an agreed upon way of communicating
    between systems) and not a particular software application, if you’re
    troubleshooting, you’re looking for the application that is said to
    implement the SMB protocol.

    The SMB protocol was designed to allow computers to read and write files
    to a remote host over a local area network (LAN). The directories on the
    remote hosts made available via SMB are called “shares.”


  CIFS

    CIFS stands for “Common Internet File System.” CIFS is a dialect of SMB.
    That is, CIFS is a particular implementation of the Server Message Block
    protocol, created by Microsoft.


  CIFS vs SMB

    Most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same
    exact thing. The two are interchangeable not only in a discussion but also
    in application – i.e., a client speaking CIFS can talk to a server
    speaking SMB and vice versa. Why? Because CIFS is a form of SMB.

    While they are the same top level protocol, there are still differences in
    implementation and performance tuning (hence the different names).
    Protocol implementations like CIFS vs SMB often handle things like file
    locking, performance over LAN/WAN, and mass modification of file
    differently.


  CIFS vs SMB: Which One Should I Use?

    In this day and age, you should always use the acronym SMB.  I know what
    you’re thinking – “but if they’re essentially the same thing, why should I
    always use SMB?”

    Two reasons:

    1.) The CIFS implementation of SMB is rarely used these days. Under the
        covers, most modern storage systems no longer use CIFS, they use SMB 2
        or SMB 3. In the Windows world, SMB 2 has been the standard as of
        Windows Vista (2006) and SMB 3 is part of Windows 8 and Windows Server
        2012.

    2.) CIFS has a negative connotation amongst pedants. SMB 2 and SMB 3 are
        massive upgrades over the CIFS dialect, and storage architects who are
        near and dear to file sharing protocols don’t appreciate the misnomer.
        It’s kind of like calling an executive assistant a secretary.
