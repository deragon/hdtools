  How to check if X server is running?
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    From:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/637005/how-to-check-if-x-server-is-running

    if ! xset q &>/dev/null; then
      echo "No X server at \$DISPLAY [$DISPLAY]" >&2
      exit 1
    fi



TOOLS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  xdpyinfo

    Display information about running X instance.

  xev

    Reports all X events on stdout.

  xvidtune

    To setup video alignement and print out mode lines.  To get
    current mode line, type:  xvidtune -show

  xkill

    Kills X client by selecting them.

  startx

    Start an new X instance.



XAUTH
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
http://oracleappstechnology.blogspot.com/2008/03/xlib-invalid-mit-magic-cookie-1-key.html

When I executed xhost + command on a Solaris box as root. I got the following error:

root@apps11i # DISPLAY=apps11i:1
root@apps11i # export DISPLAY
root@apps11i # xhost +
Xlib: connection to "apps11i:1.0" refused by server
Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
xhost: unable to open display "apps11i:1"

This error is the correct behavior because xhost + command can be executed by that user who has started the X session. Solaris is protecting a particular user's processes by disallowing other users to control it. In my case it was a vnc session started through a different user. Once I logged in as that user

root@apps11i # su - applmgr
applmgr@apps11i # xhost +
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host

    Are you aware that you have opened your X server validated as root for your entire network?

    Doesn't seem like a good idea.

    Better to use SSH X-tunneling, and re-use your X cookie(s) in the root session:

    $ xauth list > /tmp/x.authentication.cookies
    $ su -
    # cat /tmp/x.authentication.cookies | while read COOKIE; do
    xauth add $COOKIE
    done
    #

    Yes I am aware of that. I'll try what you have suggested. The other way is to xhost particular hosts only.

    small correction: only "su" works, not "su -"; "su -" resets the environment, which means also the DISPLAY variable is reset.

    Another option is to allow root connections via ssh using localhost, which mean you could forward your tunneled X session using "ssh -X root@localhost". If root & X are really necessary this is an option, but also not a very secure one.

    it may sound a bit paranoid, but it's best not te leave any paths open which could allow traffic to root or a root session directly.

    this means that xhost + particular hosts is not secure.

    If you are curious about X tunneling and a following X session (which means you can hop to any server using ssh and keeping X working), see: http://frits.homelinux.com/wordpress/?p=23

    Adding -ac to the startup command solved my problem. See this for more infomation http://mattfleming.com/node/92

    also using ssh -YX user@host will turn off xauth completely or ignore it in a pinch.



TROUBLESHOOTING NVIDIA
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Syndrom showing up in /etc/var/syslog:

    NVRM: API mismatch: the client has the version 295.49, but
    NVRM: this kernel module has the version 304.43.  Please
    NVRM: make sure that this kernel module and all NVIDIA driver
    NVRM: components have the same version.
    init: lightdm main process (1431) terminated with status 1

  Solution:

    2 versions of nvidia driver co-exists.  Remove the wrong one:

    apt-get remove nvidia-current-updates

PRIMARY / SECONDARY CLIPBOARD OR SELECTION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  IMPORTANT
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    By default, a selection in PRIMARY (selection in a terminal, for example)
    will not be saved in CLIPBOARD.

    If you wish this to happen, use CopyQ and in the Preferences / General,
    select "Store text selected using mouse".


  EXPLANATIONS
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Paste primary without any middle button:   3 fingers punch on the
    touchpad.

    De: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/139191/whats-the-difference-between-primary-selection-and-clipboard-buffer


    PRIMARY selection is typically used by e.g. terminals when selecting text
    and pasting it by pressing middle mouse button. As in selected text is in
    Primary Clipboard without any explicit copy action taking place.
    Quick-Copy is a good name for it. (Not limited to terminal emulators, but
    as an example.)

    CLIPBOARD is primarily used in connection with MS Windows-style clipboard
    operations. Select+Copy. The data resides in the buffer.

    SECONDARY is not used.



  GET AND SET CLIPBOARDS
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    From: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84951/copy-markdown-input-to-the-clipboard-as-rich-text

    Copy Markdown file into rich html text in PRIMARY X clibpard.

      pandoc -S file.mkd | xclip -t text/html

    ...and then I can paste it straight into the document in libreoffice,
    properly formatted. This works with the versions of the programs in the
    Ubuntu 13.04 repositories (pandoc 1.10.1 and xclip 0.12) -- the -t option
    for xclip especially is only in version 0.12 or above. The -S option of
    pandoc makes it produce 'typographically correct output', so -- is turned
    into an en-dash, --- is turned into an em-dash, and a few other things.

    Copy Markdown file into rich html text in CLIPBOARD clibpard.

      pandoc -S file.mkd | xclip -t text/html -selection clipboard
