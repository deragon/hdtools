Garbage collection (GC)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Read:  https://manual.seafile.com/maintain/seafile_gc/

  Just run 'seaf-gc.sh' without any repo and all the repository will execute.
  The name of the repo is not enough to identify it.  Maybe it is the UUID of
  the repo that needs to be provided.  The manual is not clear about this.



TROUBLESHOOTING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  File path contains symbols that are not supported by Windows - I use Linux!
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Go to

      - Settings (mechanical wheel just right of user name)
      - Basic tab
      - Check "Hide Windows incompatiblity paths Message"


  Impossible to delete file for repository setup to keep full history.
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Consequences:

    - If you copied files by accident into a library, such as an large iso file,
      then that useless ISO file will be stored permanently

    - Confidential files can never be totally deleted; their history will always
      remain available

    - The database storing the library always continues to grow with time, since
      cleanup is impossible.


  Cannot copy files by any means (including with the API) between encrypted
  libraries.
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Seafile does not provide the means to copy files from one encrypted
    library to another encrypted library.

    $ hd-seafile-copy-files.sh
    $ tail -f seahub.log
