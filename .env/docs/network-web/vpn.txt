SShuttle (excellent)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


  Using SSH, you can reroute all traffic, easily from your client to your
  remote server using ssh with Shuttle.  You do not need any admin rights on
  the server, only that Python is available on it.

    Did you know that you can create a VPN tunnel using SSH? There's a
    lesser-known tool (available for both Linux and macOS) called sshuttle.
    With this tool, you can transform an SSH connection into a VPN connection
    with relative ease. The sshuttle tool is command-line only but doesn't
    require too much knowledge of the CLI to get it to work.

    If you can reach reach a host on the remote network with SSH, you could
    set up port forwarding. But this can be painful, especially if you need to
    work with many hosts on that network. Enter sshuttle — which lets you set
    up a quick and dirty VPN with just SSH access. Read on for more
    information on how to use it.
