DAO:  Data access object

    From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object

    Data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface
    to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping
    application calls to the persistence layer, DAOs provide some specific
    data operations without exposing details of the database. This isolation
    supports the Single responsibility principle. It separates what data
    accesses the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and
    data types (the public interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be
    satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc. (the implementation
    of the DAO).



DTO:  Data transfer object

    From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Transfer_Object

    Data transfer object (DTO)[1][2] is an object that carries data between
    processes. The motivation for its use has to do with the fact that
    communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote
    interfaces (e.g. web services), where each call is an expensive
    operation.[2] Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to
    the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing
    the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data
    that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served
    by one call only.[2]

    The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data
    access objects is that a DTO does not have any behavior except for storage
    and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators). DTOs are simple
    objects that should not contain any business logic that would require
    testing.[1]

    DTO is an abbreviation for Data Transfer Object, so it is used to transfer
    the data between classes and modules of your application. DTO should only
    contain private fields for your data, getters, setters and constructors.
    It is not recommended to add business logic methods to such classes, but
    it is OK to add some util methods.

    DAO is an abbreviation for Data Access Object, so it should encapsulate
    the logic for retrieving, saving and updating data in your data storage (a
    database, a file-system, whatever). Here is an example how the DAO and DTO
    interfaces would look like:

    interface PersonDTO {
        String getName();
        void setName(String name);
        //.....
    }

    interface PersonDAO {
        PersonDTO findById(long id);
        void save(PersonDTO person);
        //.....
    }



DDO:  Dynamic data objects

  This acronym is specific to IBM. It doesn't seem to be used through the
  industry. Here is IBM's documentation:

    https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/content-manager/latest?topic=concepts-dynamic-data-objects-ddo

    DDO is a content server-neutral representation of an object's persistent
    data. Its purpose is to contain all of the data for a single persistent
    object. It's also an interface to retrieve persistent data from, or load
    persistent data into, a content server.

    A DDO has a single persistent ID (PID), an object type, and a set of data
    items whose cardinality is called the data count. Each data item can have
    a name, a value, an ID, one or more data properties, and data property
    count. Each data property can have an ID, a name, and a value.

    For example, a DDO can represent a row of a database table whose columns
    are represented by DDO's data items and their properties. A DDO can
    contain one or more extended data objects (XDOs) that represent
    non-traditional data types. Figure 1 shows dynamic data objects and data
    items.
