#
# The issue is that your terminal is in bracketed paste mode, but doesn’t seem
# to support it properly. The issue was fixed in VTE, but xfce4-terminal is
# still using an old and unmaintained version of it.
#
# You can try temporarily turning bracketed paste mode off by using:
printf "\e[?2004l"
