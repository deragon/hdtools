-B  A higher value means more power is used but also promises higher
    performance or speed. Values between 1 and 128 allow the drive to shut
    down, whereas values from 129 to 254 forbid that from happening.

-M  Many modern hard drives allow you to slow down the head movement. Although
    doing so will increase access times, it will also reduce the noise level.

    Values between 128 and 254 are allowed, resulting in a trade-off between
    noise level and speed. Incidentally, your Linux kernel must also support
    acoustic management, which should be the case for all current major
    distributions.

-W  With write-back caching, the hard drive first stores the data to be
    written in a buffer. In this way, it can accept data much faster, which in
    the end leads to a faster write speed.

    You can activate the function with the -W1 switch.

    If hdparm will not allow this change, you need to make sure that
    write-back caching has been activated in the BIOS. However, this function
    is not recommended for all situations: In the case of a power outage, the
    data in the buffer would be lost permanently.

-m  To speed up data transmission, a hard disk usually reads several sectors
    at the same time. 

    The -i option can be used to find the maximum setting supported by an
    installed drive (look for MaxMultSect in the  output).

-a  Get/set sector count for filesystem (software) read-ahead. This is used to
    improve performance in sequential reads of large files, by prefetching
    additional blocks in anticipation of them being needed by the running
    task. Many IDE drives also have a separate built-in read-ahead function,
    which augments this filesystem (software) read-ahead function.
