If your terminal supports
this many colors:                  8    16   256

Then you'll see approximately
this many shades of color above:
System colors ..................   8    16   8-16
Color squares (each) ...........   3    10    36
Greyscale ramp (incl. black) ...   1     4    25

See /usr/share/doc/screen/README.Cygwin for information about 256-color
terminal support in Cygwin.
