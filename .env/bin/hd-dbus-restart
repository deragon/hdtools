# /etc/init.d/dbus restart — this command is probably well-known to all
# Feisty users. NetworkManager cannot detect any network? The computer
# fails to hibernate or suspend? GNOME acts unstable? Restarting DBUS
# service is a magic cure to all. It’s great but… doesn’t the fact that
# I have to complain about it disqualifies the distribution as a
# “regular user” friendly? Well, yes it does.
