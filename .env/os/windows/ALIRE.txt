MESSAGE TOO LONG
======================================================================

  From:  https://cygwin.cygwin.narkive.com/kQQJ81MO/resource-temporarily-unavailable#post8

    In my case I tracked the problem down to a large environment block.
    In windows CreateProcessAsUser you can only pass in an environment
    string less than 32000 characters. Unless you use Unicode which
    cygwin does not.

    A simple fix for this in our build environment was to append a env
    -i to the front of our command. This removed the user's environment
    and only allowed our build to use the environment. Our build in this
    case was adding 29000 worth of characters.

    I have since changed our build to not add all of these variables.

    Unfortunately you might not be getting the same error. If you look
    at the cygwin source there are many errors that get mapped to
    "Resource Temporarily Unavailable."

    The way I tracked this down was by using a debug release of cygwin I
    changed the error messages to the actual windows numbers. That way
    when my process errored I could see it. 

    Another option is to use strace and look through the log, it lists
    the Win32 error there. 

    Hope that helps,
    Chris McIntosh
