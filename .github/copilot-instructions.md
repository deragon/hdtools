This project contains multiples scripts mostly written in Bash and Python.
The very vast majority of the scripts are based from the following scripts:

  hd-create-script-template.py for Python scripts.
  hd-create-script-template.sh for Bash scripts.

New scripts should be based on the code found there, particularly any
new script must make use of the argument parsing and validation of these
arguments found in these templates.

The language to be used across this project is English.
