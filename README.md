==================================================

Personal various Linux scripts (in Python and Bash mostly) I wrote through the years.



Licence
==================================================

All scripts I wrote are licenced under the GPL 3.0 licence and are identified
as such within.

However, many scripts have snippets obtained from the web and it is possible that one or more script I have not written or I obtained elsewhere and where was added to this repository.
