==================================================

Personal various Linux scripts (in Python and Bash mostly) I wrote through the years.



Licence
==================================================

All scripts I wrote are licenced under the [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) and are identified as such
within.  That said, not all scripts in this repository have been written by me
and can thus bare another licence.  Also, many of my scripts have snippets
without a licence obtained from the web.

If in any case, you find / feel that I have relicence a script or piece of
code that should not have been, please do not hesitate to contact me; I will
promptly fix this issue.
